      <h2>Practise what you learned</h2>

        <li>
          <h3>How do you make a Circle in CSS?</h3>
          <p>
            To create a circle, use the border-radius property and set the value to 50%. Then combine the height and width properties with a matching value:<br/><br/>
            .dot {<br/>
                height: 25px;<br/>
                width: 25px;<br/>
                background-color: none;<br/>
                border:1px solid black;<br/>
                border-radius: 50%;<br/>
                display: inline-block;<br/>
              }
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>What is Z-index?</h3>
          <p>
            Z Index (z-index) is a CSS property that defines the order of overlapping HTML elements. Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower index.<br/><br/>
            The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.<br/><br/>
            An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.<br/><br/>
            Note: z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky) and flex items (elements that are direct children of display:flex elements).<br/><br/>
            Note: If two positioned elements overlap without a z-index specified, the element positioned last in the HTML code will be shown on top. 
          </p>
        </li>

          <h3>What is a Vendor Prefix and What is it's Purpose?</h3>
          <p>
            CSS Vendor prefixes are a way for browsers to give access to new CSS
            features which are not considered stable. By using prefixes, we can
            use these newer CSS features with the browsers that support them —
            instead of waiting for all browsers to catch up.<br>
            For example, before CSS Transitions were fully supported, you’d have added the prefixes, like so:<br><br>
            .element {<br>
                -webkit-transition: all 1s ease-out;<br>
                -moz-transition: all 1s ease-out;<br>
                -ms-transition: all 1s ease-out;<br>
                -o-transition: all 1s ease-out;<br>
                transition: all 1s ease-out;<br>
            }
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>What is the difference between CSS Grid and Flexbox?</h3>
          <p>
             <strong>Grid Layout,</strong>  is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning. <br>Like tables, grid layout allow us to align elements into columns and rows. To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with <strong>display: grid,</strong> set the column and row sizes with <strong>grid-template-columns</strong> and <strong>grid-template-rows</strong>, and then place its child elements into the grid with <strong>grid-column</strong> and <strong>grid-row.</strong>
             <br>
             <br>
             <strong>Flexbox:</strong> The CSS Flexbox offers a one-dimensional layout. It is helpful in allocating and aligning the space among items in a container (made of grids). It works with all kinds of display devices and screen sizes. To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with <strong>display: flex;</strong>

          <h3>How might you Speed Up a Slow App?</h3>
          <p>
            Internally, React uses several clever techniques to minimize the number of costly DOM operations required to update the UI. While this will lead to a faster user interface without specifically optimizing for performance for many cases, there are ways where you can still speed up your React application. <br />

          <h3>What is CRUD?</h3>
          <p>
            CRUD stands for 
            <ul>
                <li>CREATE</li>
                <li>READ</li>
                <li>UPDATE</li>
                <li>DELETE</li>
            </ul><br>
            It is a mnemonic for the four basic functions of persistent storage. CRUD typically refers to operations performed in a database or datastore, but it can also apply to higher level functions of an application such as soft deletes where data is not actually deleted but marked as deleted via a status.
          </p>
        </li>

            <h3>What is OOP?</h3>
            <p>OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming.<br><br>
                Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.<br><br>
                Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:<br><br>
                OOP is faster and easier to execute<br><br>
                OOP provides a clear structure for the programs.<br><br>
                OOP helps to keep the code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug.<br><br>
                OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time.<br><br>
                <strong>Tip: </strong>The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.</p>
